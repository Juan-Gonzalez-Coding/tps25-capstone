‚úçÔ∏è Section 1: Week 11 Reflection

Answer each prompt with 3‚Äì5 bullet points:

    Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?
    - Working on a different aspect everyweek. Learning how to organize your work and prepare the foundation before
    you start buidling the app. 

    Concept Connections: Which Week 1‚Äì10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?
    - I feel the week of algorithms where we learned recursive algorithmns was a bit difficult. The week I feel strongest is tkinter and calling API. 
    Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?
    -So far there has not been any blockers for me. 
    Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?
    -Office hours will be a good resource for me if I get stuck. If not I can always reachout in slack or to the fellows.

üß† Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale

List three features + one enhancement you plan to build.
# 	Feature Name 	Difficulty (1‚Äì3) 	Why You Chose It / Learning Goal
1 	City Comparison             1       I would like to compare temperatures from cities either in different states or countries.
2 	Weather History Tracker     1		Learn how to track data and display it.    
3 	Simple Statistics           1		Learn simple stats and how to analyze it.
Enhancement 		‚Äì 	Weather Poetry 

    üß© Tip: Pick at least one ‚Äúlevel 3‚Äù feature to stretch your skills!

    Core modules and folders

    Feature modules

    Data flow between components
    Here's the revised Section 3, explicitly mentioning the .env file for API keys.

The weather app will follow a modular architecture, separating concerns into core functionalities, feature-specific modules, and a clear data flow.

Architecture Outline:

Core Modules and Folders:

    app.py: Main entry point for the application, orchestrating feature requests and overall flow.

    .env: (New) This file (not version controlled) will securely store sensitive information like API keys.

    config/:

        settings.py: Stores general application configurations such as default locations, units of measurement, and other non-sensitive parameters. It will load API keys from the .env file.

    utils/:

        api_helper.py: Manages all external API interactions (e.g., fetching current weather, historical data). It will retrieve the necessary API keys via settings.py.

        data_parser.py: Transforms raw API responses and CSV data into a consistent, application-wide data format (e.g., dictionaries or custom objects).

        validation.py: Contains functions for input validation (e.g., city names, date ranges, number of cities).

        file_manager.py: Handles reading from and writing to local data files (e.g., weather_history.csv).

    data/:

        weather_history.csv: Stores historical weather data.

Feature Modules:

    city_comparison/:

        logic.py: Handles fetching weather data for multiple cities and preparing it for comparison.

        display.py: Renders the comparison results in a user-friendly format (e.g., side-by-side temperatures).

    weather_history_tracker/:

        logic.py: Manages reading from and writing to data/weather_history.csv, including adding new entries and retrieving past data.

        display.py: Presents historical weather data, potentially with filtering options.

    simple_statistics/:

        logic.py: Implements the statistical calculations (e.g., min/max temperature, average, trends) based on historical or current data. This will involve more complex data manipulation and algorithms.

        display.py: Visualizes or presents the calculated statistics.

    weather_poetry/ (Enhancement):

        logic.py: Contains the logic for generating weather-related poetry based on current weather conditions (e.g., "It's sunny, so a joyful verse..."). This module might integrate with external language model APIs or use rule-based generation.

        display.py: Presents the generated poem to the user.

    user_interface/ (or cli/ if a command-line app):

        main_view.py: Coordinates the overall user experience, presenting menus and displaying outputs from various feature modules.

        input_handler.py: Manages user input (e.g., prompts for city names, date ranges, comparison selections).

Data Flow between Components:

    Application Startup: app.py initializes the application, including loading configurations from config/settings.py. settings.py will, in turn, load sensitive API keys from the .env file.

    User Input: The user_interface/input_handler.py module captures user requests (e.g., "Compare London and Paris," "Show history for Berlin," "Generate stats for New York," "Tell me a weather poem").

    Request Routing: app.py receives the user request and routes it to the appropriate feature module's logic.py (e.g., city_comparison/logic.py, weather_history_tracker/logic.py, simple_statistics/logic.py, weather_poetry/logic.py).

    API Call / Data Retrieval:

        For current data (e.g., for City Comparison, Weather Poetry, and possibly for adding new history entries): The respective logic.py module uses utils/api_helper.py to make calls to external weather APIs. api_helper.py will access the necessary API keys securely loaded via settings.py.

        For historical data (e.g., for Weather History Tracker, Simple Statistics): The logic.py module uses utils/file_manager.py to read data from data/weather_history.csv.

    Data Parsing and Validation:

        Raw API responses are passed to utils/data_parser.py for transformation into a standardized application-wide data model.

        CSV data read from weather_history.csv is also parsed by utils/data_parser.py into usable structures.

        User inputs are validated by utils/validation.py to ensure correctness before processing.

    Data Processing / Feature Logic: The logic.py modules within each feature process the parsed data according to their specific functions (e.g., comparing temperatures for city_comparison, performing aggregations for simple_statistics, generating text for weather_poetry).

    Data Storage (Historical): When new current weather data is retrieved and relevant, the weather_history_tracker/logic.py module (via utils/file_manager.py) appends this data to data/weather_history.csv.

    Data Display: The processed results from the logic.py modules are then passed to their corresponding display.py modules (e.g., city_comparison/display.py, simple_statistics/display.py) to be formatted and rendered by the user_interface/main_view.py for presentation to the user.
